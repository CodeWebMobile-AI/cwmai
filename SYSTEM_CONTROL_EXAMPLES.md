# CWMAI System Control Examples

The conversational AI assistant can now monitor and control the continuous AI system through natural language.

## Example Conversations

### Checking System Status

```
You > Is the continuous AI running?
Assistant > Let me check the continuous AI system status...

‚ùå The continuous AI system is not currently running.

Would you like me to start it for you?

You > Yes, please start it with 5 workers
Assistant > Starting the continuous AI system with 5 workers...

‚úÖ Continuous AI system started successfully!
‚Ä¢ Process ID: 12345
‚Ä¢ Workers: 5
‚Ä¢ Mode: production
‚Ä¢ Log file: continuous_ai.log

The system is now running and processing tasks.
```

### Monitoring System Health

```
You > How's the continuous AI doing?
Assistant > Let me check the health of the continuous AI system...

üìä Continuous AI Health Report:
‚Ä¢ Status: Running ‚úÖ
‚Ä¢ Health Score: 85/100 (Good)
‚Ä¢ Uptime: 2 hours, 34 minutes
‚Ä¢ Workers: 5 active
‚Ä¢ Tasks Processed: 127
‚Ä¢ Success Rate: 94%
‚Ä¢ CPU Usage: 45%
‚Ä¢ Memory: 1.2 GB

The system is running smoothly with good performance.
```

### Handling Issues

```
You > The continuous AI seems slow
Assistant > Let me analyze the continuous AI system...

‚ö†Ô∏è System Performance Analysis:
‚Ä¢ Health Score: 65/100 (Fair)
‚Ä¢ High CPU usage detected: 89%
‚Ä¢ Memory usage elevated: 3.8 GB
‚Ä¢ Task queue backlog: 45 tasks

Recommendations:
1. Consider restarting the system to clear memory
2. Reduce worker count to 3 to lower CPU load
3. Check for any stuck or long-running tasks

Would you like me to restart the system with optimized settings?
```

### Stopping the System

```
You > Please stop the continuous AI
Assistant > Stopping the continuous AI system...

‚úÖ Continuous AI system stopped successfully.
‚Ä¢ Shutdown was graceful
‚Ä¢ All tasks completed or saved
‚Ä¢ State preserved for next run

The system has been stopped cleanly.
```

## Natural Language Variations

The assistant understands many ways to ask about the system:

### Starting the System
- "Start the continuous AI"
- "Can you turn on the main system?"
- "Launch the continuous AI with 3 workers"
- "Boot up the continuous AI in test mode"
- "Initialize the main system please"

### Checking Status
- "Is the continuous AI running?"
- "Check if the main system is active"
- "What's the status of the continuous AI?"
- "Show me the continuous AI status"
- "Is the system online?"

### Monitoring Health
- "How's the continuous AI doing?"
- "Monitor the system health"
- "Check the continuous AI performance"
- "Is the system healthy?"
- "Analyze the continuous AI"

### Stopping the System
- "Stop the continuous AI"
- "Shut down the main system"
- "Turn off the continuous AI"
- "Kill the continuous AI process"
- "Terminate the system"

## Advanced Control

```
You > The system crashed, can you force stop it and restart?
Assistant > I'll force stop the continuous AI and restart it...

‚ö†Ô∏è Force stopping continuous AI (PID: 12345)...
‚úÖ Process terminated

Starting fresh instance...
‚úÖ Continuous AI restarted successfully!
‚Ä¢ New PID: 12346
‚Ä¢ Workers: 3 (reduced for stability)
‚Ä¢ Mode: production
‚Ä¢ Monitoring enabled

The system has been restarted and is now running normally.
```

## Integration with Other Commands

```
You > Create a task to optimize database queries, then start the continuous AI to process it
Assistant > I'll create the task and then start the continuous AI...

‚úÖ Task created: "Optimize database queries"
‚Ä¢ ID: TASK-2024-001
‚Ä¢ Priority: High
‚Ä¢ Status: Pending

Now starting the continuous AI to process this task...
‚úÖ Continuous AI started with 3 workers
‚Ä¢ The system will pick up your task shortly
‚Ä¢ You can monitor progress with "show task status"
```

## Error Handling

```
You > Start the continuous AI
Assistant > Let me check if the continuous AI can be started...

‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot start the continuous AI:
‚Ä¢ System is already running (PID: 12345)
‚Ä¢ Uptime: 45 minutes

Would you like me to:
1. Show the current status
2. Restart the system
3. Leave it running
```

The conversational AI makes system management natural and intuitive!
