# Worker Monitor Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Redis Key Mismatch
**Problem**: The worker status monitor was looking for keys at `workers:{worker_id}` but the Redis lockfree state manager stores them at `worker:state:{worker_id}`.

**Fix Applied**: Updated `worker_status_monitor.py` line 132:
```python
# Before:
worker_data = await self.redis_state_manager.get_state(f"workers:{worker_id}")

# After:
worker_data = await self.redis_state_manager.get_worker_state(worker_id)
```

### 2. Incorrect Redis Update Method
**Problem**: The continuous orchestrator was using `update_state()` with the wrong key format.

**Fixes Applied**: Updated `continuous_orchestrator.py` at lines 494 and 526:
```python
# Before:
await self.redis_state_manager.update_state(
    f"workers:{worker.id}", 
    worker_data,
    distributed=True
)

# After:
await self.redis_state_manager.update_worker_state(
    worker.id, 
    worker_data
)
```

### 3. Delayed Status Updates
**Problem**: Worker status was only updated every 30 seconds, causing the monitor to show stale data.

**Fixes Applied**: 
1. Added immediate status update when work starts (line 668 in `continuous_orchestrator.py`)
2. Added immediate status update when work completes (line 737)

```python
# When work starts:
worker_data = {
    'status': worker.status.value,
    'specialization': worker.specialization,
    'last_activity': datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),
    'total_completed': worker.total_completed,
    'total_errors': worker.total_errors,
    'current_task': {
        'id': work_item.id,
        'title': work_item.title,
        'task_type': work_item.task_type,
        'repository': work_item.repository,
        'started_at': work_item.started_at.isoformat() if work_item.started_at else None
    }
}
await self.redis_state_manager.update_worker_state(worker.id, worker_data)

# When work completes:
worker.status = WorkerStatus.IDLE
worker.current_work = None
# Similar update with current_task set to None
```

## Results

With these fixes:
1. ✅ Worker monitor can now correctly read worker states from Redis
2. ✅ Worker status updates immediately when workers start or complete tasks
3. ✅ Monitor shows real-time worker activity instead of stale data
4. ✅ The timestamp mismatch issue is resolved (updates happen immediately)

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fixes:
```bash
python test_worker_monitor_fix.py
```

The test will:
- Create a test worker in Redis using the correct methods
- Verify the monitor can read the worker state
- Confirm that the worker data matches what was set
- Clean up test data after completion

## Key Insights

The main issue was a disconnect between how different components were storing and retrieving worker state in Redis:
- The lockfree state manager uses prefixed keys and specific methods
- The orchestrator was using generic methods with incorrect keys
- The monitor was looking in the wrong location

By standardizing on the lockfree state manager's methods (`update_worker_state()` and `get_worker_state()`), all components now work together correctly.
