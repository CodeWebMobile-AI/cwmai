# CWMAI Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the CWMAI (CodeWebMobile AI) system to protect against common security threats and ensure secure operation of the AI automation platform.

## Security Architecture

### 1. API Security & Credential Management

#### Secure Credential Storage
- **Environment Variable Protection**: All API keys and sensitive credentials are stored in environment variables
- **Credential Validation**: Automatic format validation for all API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, GitHub, DeepSeek)
- **Secure Retrieval**: Centralized credential management through `SecureCredentialManager`
- **Masking**: Automatic masking of sensitive data in logs and outputs

#### Supported Credentials
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Anthropic Claude API access
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI GPT models (optional)
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Google Gemini API (optional)
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`: DeepSeek API (optional)
- `CLAUDE_PAT` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub repository access (required)

#### Validation Rules
- **Anthropic Keys**: Must start with `sk-ant-` and be at least 50 characters
- **OpenAI Keys**: Must start with `sk-` and be at least 40 characters
- **GitHub Tokens**: Support both classic (`ghp_`) and fine-grained (`github_pat_`) formats
- **Google Keys**: Minimum 30 characters for API keys
- **DeepSeek Keys**: Minimum 30 characters

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization

#### AI Prompt Security
- **Length Limits**: Enforced maximum prompt length (100,000 characters) to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Injection Detection**: Automatic detection of script injection attempts, JavaScript execution, and data URI attacks
- **Content Sanitization**: Removal of dangerous patterns while preserving safe content
- **Real-time Validation**: Security checks performed before every AI API call

#### Dangerous Pattern Detection
- Script tags: `<script>.*?</script>`
- JavaScript execution: `javascript:`
- Data URI attacks: `data:.*base64`
- VBScript execution: `vbscript:`

#### JSON Data Validation
- **Nesting Limits**: Maximum depth of 10 levels to prevent complexity attacks
- **Sensitive Key Detection**: Automatic identification of potentially sensitive keys (`password`, `secret`, `key`, `token`, etc.)
- **Structure Validation**: Comprehensive validation of nested data structures

### 3. Secure Logging

#### Log Security Features
- **Automatic Data Masking**: All sensitive data is automatically masked in log outputs
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent logging format with security-aware data handling
- **Safe Error Handling**: Error messages are sanitized to prevent information disclosure
- **Request Tracking**: Unique request IDs for secure audit trails

#### Masking Patterns
- API keys are masked to show only first 4 and last 4 characters
- Tokens and secrets are completely masked or truncated
- Headers with sensitive information are sanitized before logging

### 4. Dependency Security

#### Vulnerability Scanning
- **Known Vulnerability Database**: Maintained database of known vulnerable package versions
- **Automated Scanning**: Regular scanning of both requirements.txt and installed packages
- **CVE Tracking**: Integration with CVE database for vulnerability information
- **Update Recommendations**: Automatic generation of security update recommendations

#### Monitored Packages
- `requests`: HTTP library with known security issues in older versions
- `urllib3`: URL handling library with various vulnerabilities
- `certifi`: Certificate bundle with potential trust issues
- `pillow`: Image processing library with multiple CVEs
- And other common Python packages

#### Security Recommendations
- Minimum secure versions for all critical dependencies
- Regular update schedules for security patches
- Vulnerability impact assessment and prioritization

### 5. HTTP Client Security

#### Enhanced HTTPAIClient
- **Integrated Security Manager**: All AI API calls go through security validation
- **Request Validation**: Every prompt is validated before being sent to AI providers
- **Response Sanitization**: AI responses are checked for potential security issues
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

#### Security Integration
- Pre-request security validation
- Automatic prompt sanitization for medium-risk violations
- Request rejection for high-risk security violations
- Comprehensive audit logging for all AI interactions

## Security Policies
