# CWMAI Security Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the CWMAI (Code Web Mobile AI) system following a comprehensive security audit and remediation effort (Issue #22).

## Security Updates Implemented

### ðŸ”´ Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

#### 1. Command Injection Prevention
**Issue**: Multiple subprocess calls vulnerable to command injection attacks.
**Fixed in**: `scripts/safe_self_improver.py`
**Solution**:
- Added `shlex` module for proper command sanitization
- Implemented path validation to prevent path traversal
- Added `shell=False` to all subprocess calls
- Created secure test script execution using JSON configuration
- Added comprehensive input validation

**Example of secure subprocess call**:
```python
import shlex
sandbox_file_escaped = shlex.quote(sandbox_file)
result = subprocess.run(
    ['python', '-m', 'py_compile', sandbox_file_escaped],
    capture_output=True,
    text=True,
    timeout=10,
    shell=False  # Explicitly disable shell
)
```

#### 2. Insecure Pickle Deserialization
**Issue**: `predictive_models.pkl` uses unsafe pickle deserialization.
**Fixed in**: `scripts/secure_model_manager.py`
**Solution**:
- Replaced pickle with joblib for model serialization
- Implemented HMAC signature verification for model integrity
- Added checksum validation for file integrity
- Created secure migration path from pickle files
- Implemented restricted unpickler for legacy migration

**Migration process**:
```bash
python scripts/secure_model_manager.py
```

#### 3. Unsafe Self-Modification Engine
**Issue**: AI system could modify its own code without sufficient validation.
**Fixed in**: `scripts/safe_self_improver.py`
**Solution**:
- Enhanced forbidden patterns detection
- Added comprehensive input validation
- Implemented secure file operations
- Added sandbox path validation
- Restricted allowed operations and modules

### ðŸŸ  High Priority Issues Fixed

#### 4. API Key Exposure in Logs
**Issue**: API keys potentially logged in debug output.
**Fixed in**: `scripts/http_ai_client.py`
**Solution**:
- Enhanced header sanitization with comprehensive patterns
- Removed sensitive information from debug logs
- Added value length limits for non-sensitive headers
- Implemented proper redaction for all sensitive fields

#### 5. Insecure HTTP Configuration
**Issue**: Missing SSL verification and security headers.
**Fixed in**: `scripts/http_ai_client.py`
**Solution**:
- Added `verify=True` for SSL/TLS verification
- Added `allow_redirects=False` to prevent redirect attacks
- Implemented proper timeout handling
- Added comprehensive error handling

#### 6. Dependency Vulnerabilities
**Issue**: Multiple vulnerable dependencies identified.
**Fixed in**: `requirements.txt`
**Updates**:
- `gitpython`: 3.1.35 â†’ â‰¥3.1.43 (Critical RCE fixes)
- `numpy`: 1.24.3 â†’ â‰¥1.26.4 (Memory handling fixes)
- `psutil`: 5.9.5 â†’ â‰¥6.1.0 (Privilege escalation fixes)
- `pandas`: 2.0.3 â†’ â‰¥2.2.3 (Security improvements)
- Added `safety` and `bandit` for security scanning

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization
- Comprehensive pattern-based validation
- Length limits on user inputs
- Path traversal prevention
- XSS and injection attack prevention

### 2. Secure File Operations
- Path validation within repository bounds
- File extension restrictions
- Content validation against forbidden patterns
- Atomic file operations with rollback

### 3. Enhanced Forbidden Patterns
Extended security patterns to prevent:
- Code injection attacks
- Dynamic imports and eval calls
- System command execution
- Unsafe deserialization
- Dunder attribute access
- Shell command execution

### 4. Secure Model Management
- HMAC signature verification
- SHA-256 checksum validation
- Metadata tracking and versioning
- Safe migration from legacy formats
- Restricted model loading

### 5. HTTP Security
- SSL/TLS verification enforced
- Redirect attack prevention
- Proper timeout configuration
- Comprehensive header sanitization
- Request/response logging security

## Security Testing

### Running Security Tests
```bash
python test_security_fixes.py
```

### Static Security Analysis
```bash
# Install security tools
pip install bandit safety

# Run static analysis
bandit -r scripts/ -f json -o security_report.json

# Check dependencies
safety check --json
```

### Dependency Scanning
```bash
# Scan for known vulnerabilities
pip-audit --desc --format=json
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Code Development
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use parameterized queries and safe APIs
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Regular security code reviews

### 2. Dependency Management
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Use version ranges for security updates
- Monitor security advisories

### 3. AI System Security
- Validate all AI-generated content
- Implement sandboxing for code execution
- Monitor for unusual patterns or behaviors
- Maintain audit trails for all modifications

### 4. Infrastructure Security
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Regular security assessments
- Incident response procedures

## Compliance and Standards

### OWASP Top 10 Compliance
- âœ… Injection: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- âœ… Broken Authentication: Secure API key management
- âœ… Sensitive Data Exposure: Proper logging and data handling
- âœ… Security Misconfiguration: Secure defaults and configurations
- âœ… Known Vulnerable Components: Updated dependencies
- âœ… Insufficient Logging: Comprehensive security logging
- âœ… Insecure Deserialization: Replaced pickle with secure alternatives

### Security Monitoring
- Input validation failures
- Failed authentication attempts
- Suspicious file operations
- Command execution attempts
- Pattern violations

## Incident Response

### Security Event Detection
Monitor for:
- Failed validation attempts
- Path traversal attempts
- Command injection attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- File system anomalies

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Analyze scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Prevent further damage
4. **Recovery**: Restore from known good state
5. **Review**: Update security measures

## Future Security Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Enhanced Sandboxing**: Container-based isolation
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Advanced threat detection
3. **Automated Testing**: Continuous security validation
4. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking
5. **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions

### Recommendations
1. Implement regular penetration testing
2. Add runtime application self-protection (RASP)
3. Implement secrets management system
4. Add rate limiting and DDoS protection
5. Implement content security policies
