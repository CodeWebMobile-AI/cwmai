# Redis Integration Async/Await Fixes Summary

## Overview
Fixed missing `await` keywords in Redis integration code that were causing coroutine-related errors.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Redis Work Queue (`redis_work_queue.py`)
- **Issue**: `'coroutine' object has no len()` at line 334
- **Root Cause**: The error message was misleading - the actual issue was that `xclaim` was already properly awaited
- **Status**: No changes needed in this file

### 2. Redis Streams Manager (`redis_streams_manager.py`)
- **Issue**: `'coroutine' object is not iterable` when calling `xreadgroup`
- **Root Cause**: The `xreadgroup` method in redis_client.py was using a lambda without await
- **Fix**: Updated redis_client.py to properly await the operation

### 3. Redis State Manager (`redis_state_manager.py`)
- **Issue**: `the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not coroutine`
- **Status**: No issues found - `redis.get` calls were already properly awaited

### 4. Worker Status Monitor (`worker_status_monitor.py`)
- **Issue**: `object int can't be used in 'await' expression`
- **Root Cause**: Trying to await `get_queue_size_sync()` which returns an int, not a coroutine
- **Fix**: Removed `await` keyword on line 200

## Fixed Redis Client Operations

Updated the following methods in `redis_client.py` to properly await async operations:

### Stream Operations
- `xadd` - Fixed lambda to use async function with await
- `xreadgroup` - Fixed lambda to use async function with await
- `xack` - Fixed lambda to use async function with await
- `xclaim` - Fixed lambda to use async function with await
- `xgroup_create` - Fixed lambda to use async function with await
- `xinfo_stream` - Fixed lambda to use async function with await
- `xrevrange` - Fixed lambda to use async function with await
- `xtrim` - Fixed lambda to use async function with await
- `xpending` - Fixed lambda to use async function with await
- `xpending_range` - Fixed lambda to use async function with await

### Other Async Operations
- `eval` - Fixed lambda to use async function with await
- `evalsha` - Fixed lambda to use async function with await
- `script_load` - Fixed lambda to use async function with await
- `scan` - Fixed lambda to use async function with await
- `script_flush` - Fixed lambda to use async function with await

## Pattern Applied

Changed from:
```python
return await self.execute_with_retry(lambda conn, *args: conn.method(*args), ...)
```

To:
```python
async def _method(conn, *args):
    return await conn.method(*args)
return await self.execute_with_retry(_method, ...)
```

## Key Insight

The issue was that Redis stream operations (and some other operations like eval/scan) in the `redis.asyncio` library are async and need to be awaited. When using lambdas with `execute_with_retry`, the lambda itself wasn't awaiting the coroutine, causing it to return a coroutine object instead of the actual result.

Regular Redis operations (get, set, hget, etc.) work fine with lambdas because they handle the async internally.
