## How It Works

### 1. Context Gathering
```python
# The system continuously gathers context from multiple sources
context = await context_aggregator.gather_comprehensive_context()
# Includes: repository health, tech distribution, market insights, 
# cross-repo patterns, external signals, historical patterns
```

### 2. Predictive Analysis
```python
# ML models predict future task needs
predictions = await predictive_engine.predict_next_tasks(context)
# Analyzes trends and detects early warnings
warnings = await predictive_engine.detect_early_warnings(context, history)
```

### 3. Intelligent Task Generation
```python
# Generate tasks with full intelligence features
tasks = await task_generator.generate_multiple_tasks(context, count=5)
# Each task includes:
# - Multi-dimensional quality scoring
# - Cross-repository optimization
# - Predictive priority adjustment
# - External signal influence
```

### 4. Progressive Follow-ups
```python
# When tasks complete, generate intelligent follow-ups
next_tasks = await progressive_generator.generate_next_tasks(
    completed_task, 
    progression_context
)
# Uses pattern learning and cross-project insights
```

### 5. Continuous Learning
```python
# Track outcomes and improve
progressive_generator.track_suggestion_outcome(suggestion_id, success, metadata)
predictive_engine.update_with_outcome(task_id, outcome)
```

## Intelligence Features

- Responds to external events

### Dynamic Learning
- Learns from every task outcome
- Updates patterns in real-time
- Adjusts confidence dynamically
- Evolves strategies based on success
