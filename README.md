# CWMAI - 24/7 Autonomous AI Task Management System

An intelligent task orchestration system that operates continuously, creating and managing development tasks for @claude integration.

## üöÄ Overview

CWMAI transforms AI from a developer into a **24/7 Technical Project Manager** that:
- ü§ñ Generates specific, actionable tasks every 30 minutes
- üìã Creates GitHub issues with @claude mentions for implementation  
- üìä Tracks progress and reviews completed work
- üéØ Prioritizes tasks based on business value and dependencies
- üìà Maintains a real-time dashboard of all activities

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Task Manager** (`task_manager.py`)
   - Creates and tracks tasks with full lifecycle management
   - Generates GitHub issues with @claude mentions
   - Manages dependencies and blocking relationships
   - Reviews completed work for quality assurance

2. **AI Brain** (`ai_brain.py`)
   - Intelligent decision engine for task orchestration
   - Chooses optimal actions based on system state
   - Integrates with multiple AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini)
   - Learns from historical performance

3. **Task Analyzer** (`task_analyzer.py`)
   - Analyzes GitHub issues and @claude interactions
   - Provides insights on task completion rates
   - Identifies bottlenecks and stale tasks
   - Generates actionable recommendations

4. **Dashboard Updater** (`update_task_dashboard.py`)
   - Maintains a live dashboard as a pinned GitHub issue
   - Shows real-time metrics and visualizations
   - Tracks performance over time
   - Provides system health monitoring

## üîÑ How It Works

### Continuous Operation (Every 30 Minutes)

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - System analyzes current tasks and @claude interactions
   - Identifies gaps, bottlenecks, and opportunities
   - Reviews completed work quality

2. **Decision Phase**
   - AI Brain decides the best action to take:
     - Generate new tasks
     - Review completed tasks
     - Prioritize backlog
     - Analyze performance
     - Update dashboard

3. **Execution Phase**
   - Creates detailed GitHub issues with @claude mentions
   - Updates task priorities and dependencies
   - Reviews and approves/rejects completed work
   - Updates the live dashboard

### Task Types Generated

```

## üìä Workflows

### Main Workflow (`main.yml`)
- Runs every 4 hours automatically
- Can be triggered manually with specific actions
- Executes the main AI decision cycle

### Task Manager Workflow (`continuous-task-manager.yml`)
- Runs every 30 minutes for continuous operation
- Generates, reviews, and manages tasks
- Updates the task dashboard

### Monitoring Workflow (`monitoring.yml`)
- Daily health checks
- Weekly performance reports
- System status monitoring

## üìà Dashboard

The system maintains a live dashboard as a pinned GitHub issue showing:
- Task status distribution
- Performance metrics
- @claude interaction effectiveness
- Insights and recommendations
- Recent activity

Access the dashboard by looking for the "üìä AI Task Management Dashboard" issue.

## ü§ù @claude Integration

The system leverages the `base-claude.yml` workflow to enable @claude to:
- Respond to task assignments in issues
- Create pull requests with implementations
- Provide status updates
- Request clarification when needed

## üìö Task Templates

Each task type includes specific templates optimized for @claude:
- Clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- Technical specifications
- Laravel React starter kit integration (for new projects)
- Testing and documentation requirements

## üîç Monitoring & Analytics

- **Success Rate**: Track task completion effectiveness
- **Velocity**: Measure tasks completed per day

)

# Export repository data with health score filter
filepath = export_service.export_data(
    data_type=DataType.REPOSITORIES,
    export_format=ExportFormat.JSON,
    filters={"min_health_score": 85}
)

# Run performance benchmark
benchmark = export_service.get_export_performance_benchmark(
