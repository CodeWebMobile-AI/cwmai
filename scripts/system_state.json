    "PROJECT_METHODOLOGY": {
      "architecture_phase": "Design database schema, API endpoints, component hierarchy, and deployment architecture.",
      "deployment_phase": "Prepare deployment scripts, environment configurations, and rollback procedures.",
      "development_phase": "Implement backend and frontend components in parallel, with continuous integration into the main repository.",
      "documentation_phase": "Generate developer documentation, API documentation, and user guides.",
      "initialization": "All new projects must utilize the Laravel React starter kit as the foundation, which includes pre-configured Laravel backend, React frontend, authentication system, and API scaffolding.",
      "maintenance_phase": "Establish monitoring, logging, and alerting systems for the deployed application.",
      "requirements_phase": "Generate comprehensive requirements document with user stories, technical specifications, and acceptance criteria.",
      "testing_phase": "Conduct unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and security vulnerability scanning."
    },
    "SUCCESS_METRICS": {
      "code_quality": "Static analysis scores, test coverage percentage, security vulnerability count",

    "TASK_TYPES": {
      "BUG_FIX": "Prioritize when defects are identified in existing code that impact functionality, security, or user experience. Bug fixes should include root cause analysis to prevent similar issues.",
      "DOCUMENTATION": "Generate when new projects or features are completed, significant architectural changes are made, or existing documentation is insufficient for developer or user understanding.",
      "FEATURE": "Create when extending functionality of an existing project to meet new requirements, enhance user experience, or address competitive gaps. Features should be added to the most appropriate project based on domain fit and technical compatibility.",
      "IMPROVEMENT": "Implement when analysis shows potential efficiency gains in the AI system itself, opportunities to enhance reasoning capabilities, or when new orchestration patterns emerge that could optimize development workflows.",
      "NEW_PROJECT": "Initiate when there's a clear business need for a new application that doesn't overlap with existing projects, requires a completely new codebase, or addresses a novel market opportunity. Each new project must leverage the Laravel React starter kit as foundation.",
      "OPTIMIZATION": "Undertake when performance metrics indicate bottlenecks, resource utilization inefficiencies, or opportunities to enhance speed/scalability without compromising quality."
