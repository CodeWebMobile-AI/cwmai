This will be offered as a premium feature in our commercialization strategy, creating a compelling upsell opportunity.\n\nThe implementation will follow our established Laravel-React methodology, building a data collection pipeline, training recommendation models, and creating an intuitive interface for site administrators to control and customize the recommendation behavior.
