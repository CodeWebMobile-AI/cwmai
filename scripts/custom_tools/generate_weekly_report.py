AI-Generated Tool: generate_weekly_report
Description: 
1. The system currently doesn't have a dedicated tool for generating development reports
2. However, we could combine several existing tools to create this functionality:
   - get_tasks() - to show active/completed tasks
   - count_repositories() - for repository statistics
   - get_tool_usage_stats() - for system activity metrics
   - repository_health_check() - for code quality metrics

Since this would be a valuable recurring function, I recommend creating a dedicated tool that:
1. Aggregates data from multiple sources
2. Formats it into a standardized report template
3. Includes metrics like:
   - Tasks completed/created
   - Repository changes
   - System activity
   - Code quality trends
   - Performance metrics

CREATE_TOOL: generate_weekly_report(include_graphs=True, format='markdown')

Would you like me to proceed with creating this comprehensive reporting tool? It would automatically pull data from all relevant sources and generate a formatted report.
