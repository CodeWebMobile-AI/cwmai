AI-Generated Tool: calculate_project_statistics
Description: 
The tool "calculate_project_statistics" should perform the following functions:
- Analyze the size of the project by calculating the total lines of code across all files.
- Evaluate the complexity of the project using metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, code duplication, etc.
- Provide a summary report including both size and complexity metrics for the project.

Since this functionality is not currently available, I will initiate the creation of this tool.
Generated: 2025-06-15T11:05:55.044895+00:00
Requirements: 
        Based on user request: calculate project statistics including size and complexity
        Create a tool that: 
The tool "calculate_project_statistics" should perform the following functions:
- Analyze the size of the project by calculating the total lines of code across all files.
- Evaluate the complexity of the project using metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, code duplication, etc.
- Provide a summary report including both size and complexity metrics for the project.

Since this functionality is not currently available, I will initiate the creation of this tool.
        Tool should integrate with existing system components
