# Tool Context Enhancement Summary

## Overview
The tool generation system has been enhanced to provide comprehensive context about all available scripts and tools in the CWMAI system.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Script Discovery System (`tool_generation_templates.py`)
- Added `_discover_available_scripts()` method that automatically scans:
  - All Python files in `/workspaces/cwmai/scripts/`
  - Custom tools in `scripts/custom_tools/`
  - Specialized agents in `scripts/specialized_agents/`
  - Redis integration modules in `scripts/redis_integration/`
- Extracts from each script:
  - Module docstring
  - Available classes and functions
  - Category classification
  - Import dependencies

### 2. Enhanced Import Context
- The `get_import_context()` method now provides:
  - Standard library imports
  - Third-party imports
  - **Dynamically discovered project modules** organized by category:
    - Custom Tools (44 tools discovered)
    - AI Integration modules
    - Redis/Caching modules
    - Task Management modules
    - And more...
  - Special section highlighting ready-to-use custom tools

### 3. Integration with Tool Generator
- `ImprovedToolGenerator` now uses the dynamic context
- Provides AI with awareness of all 321 available modules
- Includes module discovery summary in prompts

## Benefits

1. **Complete Context**: The AI now knows about ALL available modules and tools when generating new tools
2. **Smart Import Suggestions**: Can suggest relevant imports based on tool requirements
3. **Tool Reuse**: Highlights existing custom tools that can be called or used as examples
4. **Better Dependency Resolution**: AI can find and use the right modules for specific tasks

## Example Context Provided

```
AVAILABLE IMPORTS:

Standard Library:
- import os, sys, json, re, ast
- import asyncio, subprocess, platform
...

Project-specific Modules:
Core Project Modules:
- from scripts.state_manager import StateManager
- from scripts.task_manager import TaskManager
...

Custom Tools (Ready to Use):
- access_public_api_tool: Accesses a public API endpoint and returns the data.
- analyze_code_complexity: Analyze code complexity metrics for Python files.
- check_system_status: Check the status of all CWMAI system components
... (44 total custom tools)

AI Integration:
- from scripts.http_ai_client import HTTPAIClient
- from scripts.ai_brain import AIBrain
... (214 AI-related modules)

Total available project modules: 321
```

## Usage

When the tool generation system creates a new tool, it now:
1. Discovers all available scripts dynamically
2. Provides full context to the AI about what's available
3. Suggests appropriate imports based on the tool's purpose
4. Can reference existing tools as examples

This ensures that generated tools can leverage the full power of the CWMAI system without missing dependencies or reinventing existing functionality.
