# README Customization Issue

## Problem
The newly created projects are showing the default Laravel React starter kit README instead of a customized README that explains:
- What the specific project does
- The problem it solves
- Target audience
- Architecture details
- Monetization strategy
- etc.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **The code exists** - The project_creator.py has proper methods to generate and update README:
   - `_generate_readme()` - Creates comprehensive README with AI
   - `_customize_project()` - Calls README generation and updates the file

2. **The flow appears incomplete** - Looking at the logs, the project creation seems to stop after forking, before customization happens.

3. **Possible issues**:
   - The async flow might be interrupted
   - GitHub API might be throttling or timing out
   - The repository might not be ready immediately after creation

## Current Code Flow

1. `create_project()` is called
2. Project details are generated (with venture analyst research)
3. Repository is created (not forked, but created new with contents copied)
4. **HERE: Customization should happen but seems to stop**
5. README should be updated with project-specific content

## Fixes Applied

1. Added detailed logging to track the customization flow
2. Added a 2-second wait after repository creation to ensure GitHub is ready
3. Added error logging with full traceback for README update failures

## Expected README Content

The customized README should include:
- Project title and description
- Problem Statement (from venture analyst research)
- Target Audience and Value Proposition
- Features (from initial_features)
- Tech Stack
- Architecture Overview (from architecture generation)
- Prerequisites
- Installation steps
- Environment setup
- Development workflow
- Testing
- Deployment
- Monetization Strategy
- Contributing guidelines

## Next Steps

Run the system again with the improved logging to see:
1. If customization is being called
2. If README generation is happening
3. What specific error (if any) is preventing the update

The logging will show:
- "Starting project customization for [project-name]"
- "Generating README for [project-name]"
- "README generated, length: X chars" (if successful)
- "README successfully updated!" (if update works)
- Or detailed error with traceback if it fails
