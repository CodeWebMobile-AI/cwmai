# Worker Monitor and System Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-06-13

### Issues Identified and Fixed

#### 1. Gemini API 404 Error
**Problem**: project_creator.py was using deprecated `gemini-pro` model directly
**Fix**: Updated to use AI brain with HTTP AI client which uses `gemini-2.0-flash-001`

#### 2. Projects Not Loading from GitHub
**Problem**: continuous_orchestrator.py was using `load_state()` instead of `load_state_with_repository_discovery()`
**Fix**: Changed to use the correct method to discover repositories from GitHub organization

#### 3. Tech Stack Error
**Problem**: `'list' object has no attribute 'lower'` error in project_creator.py
**Fix**: Added type checking to handle both string and list tech_stack values

#### 4. HTTP AI Client Import Error
**Problem**: Missing import prefix in `http_ai_client.py` at line 1037
**Fix**: Changed from `from http_ai_client_helpers import` to `from .http_ai_client_helpers import`

#### 5. Worker Monitor Not Producing Updates
**Problem**: Worker monitor initialized but not logging periodic status updates
**Fix**: Modified `run_continuous_ai.py` to always log status updates, even with 0 workers

### System Status

âœ… **Fixed Issues:**
- Gemini API now using correct model
- Projects loading correctly from GitHub (7 repositories found)
- HTTP AI client imports working
- Worker monitor will now produce periodic updates

ðŸ“Š **Current State:**
- System discovered 7 repositories from CodeWebMobile-AI organization
- Projects include: business-analytics-dashboard, cms-platform-laravel-react, laravel-react-api-platform, mobile-app-platform, mobile-portfolio-app, mobile-portfolio-platform, project-analytics-dashboard
- NEW_PROJECT prompt updated with venture analyst research
- Architecture generation phase added between research and task creation
- Database changed from PostgreSQL to MySQL

### Next Steps

To verify all fixes are working:

```bash
# Reset the system
python reset_system.py

# Start with worker monitoring
export $(cat .env.local | grep -v '^#' | xargs) && python run_continuous_ai.py --mode development --log-level DEBUG --workers 10 --monitor-workers --no-research
```

Expected behavior:
- System should load 7 repositories
- Worker monitor should log status every 30 seconds
- No import errors
- Projects should be created using venture analyst research
- Architecture should be generated and stored with project details
