# Duplicate GitHub Issue Prevention - Implementation Summary

## Problem
The system was creating duplicate GitHub issues (e.g., multiple "Improve ai-creative-studio documentation" issues) because:

1. **Incomplete duplicate detection**: Different components checked different data sources
2. **Race conditions**: Multiple workers could create similar tasks simultaneously
3. **Work discovery repetition**: The intelligent work finder kept generating similar tasks

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced GitHub Issue Creator (`scripts/github_issue_creator.py`)
- Modified `_check_existing_issue()` to check **both** local task state and GitHub issues
- Returns special value `-1` when a task exists locally but hasn't created a GitHub issue yet
- Prevents creation of GitHub issues for tasks that are already in the pipeline

### 2. Added Distributed Locking (`scripts/task_manager.py`)
- Implemented dual-locking mechanism in `create_task()`:
  - Primary: Redis distributed locks (if available)
  - Fallback: File-based locks using `fcntl`
- Lock key based on task title and repository hash
- Ensures only one process can create a similar task at a time

### 3. Work Discovery Duplicate Prevention (`scripts/intelligent_work_finder.py`)
- Added duplicate checking before creating work opportunities
- Checks local task state for existing similar tasks
- Applies to all task generation scenarios:
  - Active repository improvements
  - Inactive repository tasks
  - Documentation opportunities

## Technical Details

### Lock Implementation
```python
lock_key = f"task_creation:{hashlib.md5(f'{title}:{repository}'.encode()).hexdigest()}"
```

### Duplicate Detection Flow
1. Work finder checks existing tasks before generating opportunities
2. GitHub issue creator checks both local state and GitHub
3. Task manager uses locks during creation to prevent race conditions

## Expected Outcome
- No more duplicate GitHub issues for the same task
- Better coordination between concurrent workers
- More efficient use of system resources
