# Worker Monitor Redis Connection Fix

## Problem Summary
The worker status monitor was creating excessive Redis Pub/Sub connections, leading to connection exhaustion. Each refresh cycle in continuous mode was creating new Pub/Sub managers without properly reusing connections.

## Root Causes
1. **Multiple Pub/Sub Manager Creation**: The `RedisWorkerCoordinator` was creating new `RedisPubSubManager` instances on each initialization
2. **No Connection Reuse**: In continuous monitoring mode, connections were not being reused between refresh cycles
3. **Improper Cleanup**: Pub/Sub connections were not being properly closed when refreshing

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Worker Status Monitor (`worker_status_monitor.py`)
- Added shared Redis client at class level to reuse connections
- Removed worker coordinator initialization to avoid Pub/Sub connections
- Monitor now uses only direct Redis queries without Pub/Sub

### 2. Alternative Fixed Monitor (`worker_status_monitor_fixed.py`)
- Implements a singleton pattern for Pub/Sub manager
- Ensures only one Pub/Sub manager instance is created and reused
- Proper cleanup of singleton connections on exit

### 3. Simple Monitor (`worker_status_monitor_simple.py`)
- Completely avoids Pub/Sub connections
- Uses only direct Redis queries
- Limits connection pool to 5 connections
- Lightweight and connection-efficient

## Usage

### Use the updated original monitor:
```bash
python scripts/worker_status_monitor.py --continuous --interval 5
```

### Use the singleton-based fixed monitor:
```bash
python scripts/worker_status_monitor_fixed.py --continuous --interval 5
```

### Use the simple monitor (recommended for continuous monitoring):
```bash
python scripts/worker_status_monitor_simple.py --continuous --interval 5
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Shared Resources**: Implemented class-level shared Redis clients to avoid creating new connections
2. **Removed Pub/Sub**: The monitor no longer needs Pub/Sub for status updates - it uses direct Redis queries
3. **Connection Limits**: Added explicit connection pool limits
4. **Proper Cleanup**: Ensured connections are properly closed on exit

## Monitoring Best Practices

1. **For Continuous Monitoring**: Use the simple monitor (`worker_status_monitor_simple.py`)
2. **For One-time Checks**: Any monitor variant works fine
3. **Connection Limits**: Always set explicit connection pool limits when creating Redis clients
4. **Reuse Connections**: Share Redis client instances when possible
5. **Avoid Pub/Sub for Polling**: Use direct Redis queries for periodic status checks

## Testing

Test the monitors without Redis running to ensure they handle connection failures gracefully:
```bash
# JSON output test
python scripts/worker_status_monitor_simple.py --json

# Continuous monitoring test (use Ctrl+C to stop)
python scripts/worker_status_monitor_simple.py --continuous --interval 2
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Connection Pool Monitoring**: Add metrics for connection pool usage
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Implement circuit breaker pattern for Redis connections
3. **Caching**: Add local caching to reduce Redis queries
4. **Event-Driven Updates**: Use Redis Streams for real-time updates instead of polling
