# Self-Healing Tools Implementation

## Overview
The CWMAI system now has automatic self-healing capabilities for broken tools. When a tool fails due to import errors or missing attributes, the system automatically fixes it.

## How It Works

### 1. Error Detection (`conversational_ai_assistant.py`)
When a tool execution fails, the system checks if it's a fixable error:
```python
if any(err in error_msg for err in ['No module named', 'has no attribute', 'ModuleNotFoundError', 'ImportError', 'AttributeError']):
    return await self._handle_broken_tool(tool_name, params, error_msg)
```

### 2. Automatic Fix Process (`_handle_broken_tool` method)
The system:
1. **Analyzes the error** - Understands what's wrong (missing imports, wrong module names)
2. **Reads the original tool** - Extracts its purpose and requirements
3. **Prepares enhanced requirements** - Includes specific fixes needed:
   - Correct module imports (e.g., use `workflow_orchestrator` not `workflow_manager`)
   - Available modules from the enhanced context system
   - Specific error context
4. **Deletes the broken file** - Removes the faulty implementation
5. **Regenerates the tool** - Creates a new version with correct imports
6. **Tests the fix** - Executes the regenerated tool immediately

### 3. Enhanced Context Integration
The regeneration uses the full context of 321+ available modules, ensuring:
- Correct imports are used
- No non-existent modules referenced
- Proper integration with existing system components

## Example: Fixing orchestrate_workflows

When the broken `orchestrate_workflows` tool is called:

**Before (Broken):**
```python
from scripts.tool_executor import ToolExecutor  # Doesn't exist!
from scripts.workflow_manager import WorkflowManager  # Doesn't exist!
```

**After (Auto-Fixed):**
```python
from scripts.workflow_orchestrator import WorkflowOrchestrator
from scripts.tool_calling_system import ToolCallingSystem
```

## User Experience

When a user tries to use a broken tool:

```
You > use orchestrate_workflows to list all workflows

Assistant > I detected that the 'orchestrate_workflows' tool has an error: No module named 'scripts.tool_executor'

Let me fix this tool by regenerating it with the correct imports and implementation...

âœ“ Successfully fixed and regenerated 'orchestrate_workflows'!

Available Workflows:
- data_processing_workflow
- backup_automation
- deployment_pipeline

The tool has been fixed and is now working properly.
```

## Benefits

1. **No Manual Intervention** - Tools fix themselves automatically
2. **Learning from Errors** - System understands common import mistakes
3. **Seamless Experience** - Users get results, not error messages
4. **Continuous Improvement** - Each fix makes the system smarter

## Testing

Run the test script to verify self-healing:
```bash
python test_self_healing_tools.py
```

Or simply use CWMAI normally - any broken tool will auto-fix when called!
