# Continuous Work Generation Fixes

## Problem Summary

The AI system was running out of work and sitting idle for 40% of its runtime because:
1. Work discovery only happened once at startup
2. No work generation when queues were empty
3. No minimum queue threshold maintained
4. Workers sat idle instead of finding alternative work

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Work Generator (`scripts/enhanced_work_generator.py`)
- **Proactive Work Generation**: Generates tasks based on templates and system needs
- **Emergency Mode**: Creates high-priority work when queue is empty
- **Maintenance Tasks**: Generates routine maintenance work periodically
- **Diversity**: Ensures variety in generated tasks to prevent repetition

### 2. Continuous Work Discovery
- **2-Second Intervals**: Work discovery runs every 2 seconds (not just at startup)
- **Minimum Queue Size**: Maintains at least 10 items in queue (formula: `max(10, workers * 3)`)
- **Fallback Generation**: When regular discovery fails, enhanced generator creates work
- **Periodic Maintenance**: Every 5 minutes, generates maintenance and research tasks

### 3. Improved Queue Management
- **Target Queue Size**: Increased from `workers * 2` to `max(10, workers * 3)`
- **Emergency Detection**: When queue hits 0, immediately generates 5+ emergency tasks
- **Hybrid Discovery**: Combines regular work discovery with proactive generation

## Code Changes

1. **continuous_orchestrator.py**:
   - Added `EnhancedWorkGenerator` integration
   - Modified `_discover_work()` to use enhanced generator as fallback
   - Added `_generate_periodic_maintenance_work()` method
   - Increased target queue size with minimum threshold
   - Added periodic maintenance generation every 5 minutes

2. **enhanced_work_generator.py** (new file):
   - Work generation templates for 7 task types
   - Emergency, maintenance, and research work generators
   - Tracking to ensure task diversity
   - Configurable priority levels

## Results

### Before:
- System discovered 10 tasks at startup
- Completed 5 tasks in 4 minutes
- **Sat idle for 3+ minutes** with empty queues
- System health dropped to 20% (critical)

### After:
- Work discovery runs continuously (every 2 seconds)
- Queue maintains minimum 10 items
- Emergency work generated when queue empty
- Periodic maintenance tasks every 5 minutes
- **No more idle time** - workers always have tasks

## Test Results

All tests pass:
- ✅ Enhanced Work Generator works correctly
- ✅ Continuous work discovery runs every 2 seconds
- ✅ Queue maintains minimum threshold
- ✅ Emergency work generated on empty queue

## Usage

The system now automatically:
1. Discovers work every 2 seconds
2. Maintains minimum 10 items in queue
3. Generates emergency work if queue empty
4. Adds maintenance tasks every 5 minutes
5. Falls back to enhanced generator when regular discovery fails

No configuration needed - improvements are automatic!
