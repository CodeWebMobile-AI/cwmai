# Smart Tool Generation Template Enhancements

## Overview

The `scripts/tool_generation_templates.py` has been significantly enhanced with AI-powered capabilities to make tool generation smarter, more context-aware, and self-improving.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. **Intelligent Tool Generation System**
- Created `scripts/intelligent_tool_generation_templates.py` with full AI integration
- Leverages existing AI modules: AIBrain, IntelligentSelfImprover, SemanticMemorySystem, etc.
- Machine learning-based template selection and generation

### 2. **Smart Requirement Analysis**
```python
analysis = templates.analyze_tool_requirements(name, description, requirements)
```
- AI-powered operation detection using NLP patterns
- Automatic category determination with confidence scoring
- Context-aware import suggestions based on detected operations
- Security consideration identification
- Performance requirement analysis (async needs, caching, batching)
- Complexity scoring for better tool planning

### 3. **Learning-Based Generation**
```python
result = templates.generate_smart_tool(name, description, requirements)
```
- Uses historical success/failure data to improve generation
- Semantic memory integration for finding similar successful tools
- Pattern recognition from existing tools
- Automatic code validation and improvement
- Real-time testing of generated tools
- Confidence scoring for generated code

### 4. **Pattern Learning & Evolution**
- Tracks successful patterns and their effectiveness
- Stores generated tools in semantic memory for future reference
- Learning system records outcomes for continuous improvement
- Category-specific performance tracking
- Error pattern recognition and automatic fixes

### 5. **Enhanced Template Context**
- Expanded import suggestions with 50+ standard library modules
- Design patterns and best practices embedded in prompts
- CWMAI-specific patterns for consistency
- Performance tips and security best practices
- Cross-platform compatibility considerations

### 6. **Backward Compatibility**
- Graceful fallback to template-based generation when AI is unavailable
- Works with or without the intelligent system
- Maintains all original functionality

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (with AI)
```python
from scripts.tool_generation_templates import ToolGenerationTemplates

# Initialize with AI support
templates = ToolGenerationTemplates(use_ai=True)

# Generate a smart tool
result = templates.generate_smart_tool(
    name="log_analyzer",
    description="Analyze logs for patterns",
    requirements="Parse multiple formats, detect anomalies, real-time monitoring"
)

if result['success']:
    print(f"Generated with {result['confidence']:.2f} confidence")
    print(result['code'])
```

### Requirement Analysis
```python
# Analyze requirements before generation
analysis = templates.analyze_tool_requirements(name, description, requirements)

print(f"Category: {analysis['primary_category']}")
print(f"Operations: {analysis['detected_operations']}")
print(f"Security: {analysis['security_considerations']}")
```

### Getting Insights
```python
# Get performance insights
insights = templates.get_generation_insights()
print(f"Success rate: {insights['overall_success_rate']:.2%}")
print(f"Best performing category: {insights['category_performance']}")
```

## AI Components Used

1. **AIBrain**: Intelligent decision-making for template selection
2. **IntelligentSelfImprover**: Code analysis and improvement suggestions
3. **CapabilitySynthesizer**: Pattern transformation and adaptation
4. **ImprovementLearningSystem**: Tracks success/failure patterns
5. **SemanticMemorySystem**: Stores and retrieves similar tools
6. **KnowledgeGraphBuilder**: Understands tool relationships

## Benefits

1. **Higher Quality Tools**: AI validation ensures better code quality
2. **Faster Development**: Learn from past successes
3. **Context Awareness**: Understands project structure and conventions
4. **Self-Improving**: Gets better with each generation
5. **Security Focused**: Automatic security consideration detection
6. **Performance Optimized**: Suggests async, caching, and batching when needed

## Testing

Run the test script to see the enhancements in action:
```bash
python test_smart_tool_generation.py
```

Or use the built-in demo:
```bash
python scripts/tool_generation_templates.py
```

## Future Improvements

The remaining tasks for further enhancement:
- Template evolution based on usage patterns
- More sophisticated context-aware import suggestions
- Real-time validation with actual execution
- Enhanced pattern learning from tool performance metrics
- Natural language understanding for complex requirements
