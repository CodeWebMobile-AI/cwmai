- Supports scheduled, conditional, and reactive automation
- Examples:
  - "Every morning, check for critical issues"
  - "When a PR is merged, update the documentation"
  - "If tests fail, create an issue automatically"

#### Visualization Plugin
- Generates charts from natural language requests
- Supports multiple chart types automatically
- Examples:
  - "Show me task completion trends"
  - "Visualize issue distribution by severity"
  - "Chart my productivity over the last month"

#### Explanation Plugin
- Provides intelligent explanations of any concept
- Adapts complexity to user level
- Includes learning resources and examples

#### Smart Suggestions Plugin
- Context-aware recommendations
- Time-based suggestions (morning routines, end-of-week tasks)
- Pattern-based predictions
- Workflow optimization tips

## Intelligence Examples

### Simple â†’ Smart Transformations

1. **Basic**: "create issue"
   **Smart**: "I notice you're working on auth-api. Should I create the issue there about the login performance problem you mentioned earlier?"

2. **Basic**: "search python"
   **Smart**: "I'll search for Python libraries related to your current project's needs (API development). I'll also check what's trending in the Python ecosystem."

3. **Basic**: "make chart"
   **Smart**: "Based on your recent focus on performance, I'll create a line chart showing response times over the past week with anomaly detection."

### Complex Understanding

The system can understand and execute complex, multi-part requests:

```
"Find all my projects that use outdated dependencies, 
create issues for updating them with priority based on 
security vulnerabilities, and generate a migration plan 
for the most critical ones"
```

This single command will:
1. Search all projects
2. Analyze dependencies
3. Check for vulnerabilities
4. Create prioritized issues
5. Generate migration documentation

### Contextual Intelligence

The system maintains deep context:

```
User: "Create an issue for the auth problem"
System: [Creates issue in auth-api with details from previous conversation]

User: "Make another one for the same thing but for signup"
System: [Creates similar issue, adapting the context for signup instead of login]

User: "Now create tasks for both"
System: [Creates implementation tasks linked to both issues]
```

### Learning Examples

After repeated use, the system learns:

```
First week:
User: "show status, then check for new issues, then create tasks for critical ones"

Second week:
User: "do my morning routine"
System: [Automatically executes the learned sequence]
```

### Market Intelligence

Real-time market awareness:

```
User: "I want to build something like Stripe but for crypto"
System: 
- Analyzes current crypto payment solutions
- Identifies market gaps
- Suggests differentiators
- Generates architecture with compliance considerations
- Provides competitive analysis
```

## Technical Intelligence

### Code Understanding
- Analyzes code patterns in your projects
- Suggests improvements based on best practices
- Identifies potential issues before they occur

### Architecture Intelligence

- Includes scalability considerations
- Suggests technology stacks based on team expertise
- Provides cost optimization strategies

### Task Intelligence
- Automatically prioritizes tasks based on impact
- Suggests task dependencies
- Estimates complexity from descriptions
- Identifies potential blockers

## Adaptive Intelligence

The system adapts to:

### Your Communication Style
- Formal vs casual language
- Technical vs high-level descriptions
- Brevity vs detail preferences

### Your Work Patterns
- Morning vs evening productivity
- Batch vs incremental work style
- Focus areas and interests

### Your Team Context
